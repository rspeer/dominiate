# Exports
# -------

# Indecisive imports
# ------------------
# Recall that this code begins with:
#
#     {c} = require './cards' if exports?
#
# This means "get the variable named `c` from the module `./cards`. Unless
# there's no module system. In that case, don't."
#
# Here's why that is useful. When the code
# is running inside node.js, it will use node.js's import system. This
# uses the predefined function `require`, which doesn't exist in a 
# Web browser's JS environment.
#
# When running in a web browser, there is no sane way for one module to
# import another. Instead,
# the typical practice -- which we will use too -- is to just load a bunch of
# JavaScript files into the same global namespace.
#
# In that case, the variable `c` already exists without any additional effort
# from us. We're polluting the global namespace and defeating some of the
# point of modules, but that's how most JavaScript in the wild works anyway.
