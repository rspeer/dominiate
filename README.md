Dominiate
=========

Dominiate is a Dominion simulator, in which you can program bots to follow
strategies that you define and see which one wins.

It is inspired by Geronimoo's Dominion Simulator. It shares the feature that,
to define many possible strategies, you may simply list cards and conditions in
which to buy them in priority order.

The code is meant to be open and extensible. Many other aspects of a strategy
can be overridden, including its preferences for how to play actions. If this
system doesn't allow you to define the strategy you want and you're okay with
writing more code, I encourage you to fork the simulator and change it so that
it does.

Dominiate is written in CoffeeScript, which compiles to JavaScript. This means
it can either run at the command line using node.js, or it can run natively
in a Web browser!

Documentation
-------------
The `docs` directory contains documentation in the "literate programming" style
-- that is, it shows you the code in parallel with explanations of what it
does.

Installation
------------
To use the command-line version, you will need a reasonable development
environment with a command line.

First, acquire node.js (v0.4 or later) and npm (the Node Package Manager).  The
best way to do this differs by operating system and changes a lot.

Enable CoffeeScript by running `sudo npm-g install coffee-script` (or whatever
the equivalent is on Windows). Now node.js will understand CoffeeScript source
files.

Running "./play.coffee bot1 bot2" will load the bots with the
specified names and play them against each other. For example:

    ./play.coffee strategies/BigMoney.coffee strategies/ChapelWitch.coffee

Building the Web app
--------------------
The Web version of Dominiate is built using CoffeeScript and Less CSS.

**On a reasonable UNIX computer** (including Linux and Mac OS):
Follow the instructions above to set up CoffeeScript. You should also install
Less CSS with `sudo npm-g install less`.

Then, type `make` to build the JavaScript and CSS files that will be used
on the Web.

Do not edit the computer-written JavaScript directly! That way lies madness.

**On Windows**: you can now compile the CoffeeScript files on Windows, using an
included CoffeeScript compiler, `windows/coffee.exe`. (Being an .exe file
downloaded from the Internet, you of course run this at your own risk.)

Running `windows/compile.bat` should do the Right Thing, but I haven't tested
it. See `windows/README` for more information.

Roadmap
-------
Short-term planned features include:

- Implement almost all the cards
- Don't buy cards that make you instantly lose
- Test cases, making sure the simulator keeps working in weird situations

Some specific features I hope for Dominiate to eventually have appear tagged
with "feature" on the Issues list.
