# The Basic AI
# ------------
# This class defines a rule-based AI of the kind that is popular
# for evaluating Dominion strategies. It can be subclassed -- or simply
# have its methods overwritten on an instance -- to play new strategies.
#
# Every time the player needs to make a meaningful decision, a method called
# `chooseX` (for some X) will be called on the AI, which can examine the game
# state and make a decision accordingly.
#
# In any case that is not a simple yes/no decision, the method will be 
# given a list of choices. It will first check a method called `xPriority`,
# which takes in the state and returns an ordered list of choices.
# The player will make the first valid choice in that list. Choices are
# skipped when they have an "if" clause that fails.
#
# If the priority list doesn't choose anything, or if there is no priority
# function, it will consult the `xValue` method instead, which takes in
# a specific choice and assigns it a numerical value.
#
# Priority functions are usually easier to define than value functions, but
# value functions can easily cover every possible case.
#
# The BasicAI has a default decision function for every decision, so
# every AI that derives from it will have *some* way to decide what to do in
# any situation. However, when defining an AI, you will often want to override
# some of these decision functions.

  # This is passed in as an argument `my` to the decision functions, because
  # it's convenient and it creates nice idioms such as `my.hand`.

  # Decision-making machinery
  # -------------------------
  # Make the AI's preferred choice, first by checking its explicit priority
  # list. If no valid choices are on the list, ask the value function instead.
  #
  # The priority function returns an ordered list of choices it will want to
  # make when they are available. If 'null' is on the priority list, that
  # represents an explicit preference to choose "none of the above" when it's
  # an option.
  #
  # The value list assigns a numerical value to every possible choice. 'null'
  # automatically has a value of 0. Here you can represent actions you will
  # only take when forced to, by giving them negative values.
  #
  # If a choice should be made entirely using the value function, make the
  # priority function return an empty list.
