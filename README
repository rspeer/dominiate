Golem
=====
What do you get when you merge together

- drheld's Dominion extension for Chrome
- councilroom.com and its 750,000 analyzed games
- and the awesome machine learning in Vowpal Wabbit?

You get a Dominion bot. 

The name
--------
When you take a robot and make it Dominion-themed, you get a Golem.

So what does it do?
-------------------
The core of Golem is a function that evaluates a game state, containing its
deck, an opponent's deck, and the supply, and returns a positive or negative
value representing that deck's ability to win. Much of what it does so far is
serving a JSON API for this.

It can also hook into the Dominion Point Counter in a kind of flaky way to
become a semi-bot that suggests what to buy.
