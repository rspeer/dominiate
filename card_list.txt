Cards that still need to be coded (18)
======================================

Possibly easy cards
-------------------
Though they will generally involve defining new decisions, there should be a
fair amount of code you can reuse for these cards.

Contraband
Governor
Mining Village
Minion
Swindler (probably needs a list of cards that are likely to suck, plus different strategies for the early/late game)

Not-so-easy cards
-----------------
These are likely to require new helper functions or decisions that are hard
to write.

Apprentice
Bishop
Black Market (requires a new setup step)
Develop (the hard part is making the list of choices)
Embargo (the trick is guessing what your opponent wants)
Forge
Inn
Native Village
Salvager

Difficult cards
---------------
In estimated order of difficulty:

Scheme (adds a new sub-phase to cleanup)
Secret Chamber (avoid infinite loops)
Stash (requires a decision mid-shuffle)
Possession (will require entirely new kinds of AI decisions)
