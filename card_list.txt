Cards that still need to be coded (12)
======================================

Possibly easy cards
-------------------
Though they will generally involve defining new decisions, there should be a
fair amount of code you can reuse for these cards.

Contraband
Governor
Swindler (probably needs a list of cards that are likely to suck, plus different strategies for the early/late game)

Not-so-easy cards
-----------------
These are likely to require new helper functions or decisions that are hard
to write.

Black Market (requires a new setup step)
Develop (the hard part is making the list of choices)
Embargo (the trick is guessing what your opponent wants)
Forge (exponentially increasing number of choices!)
Inn
Native Village

Difficult cards
---------------
In estimated order of difficulty:

Scheme (adds a new sub-phase to cleanup)
Stash (requires a decision mid-shuffle)
Possession (will require entirely new kinds of AI decisions)
