# Dominion cards and their effects are defined in this file.  Each card is a
# singleton, immutable object.

# We begin by creating the `c` object, an exported object with which one can 
# look up any card by its name.

# Defining cards
# --------------
# Many cards are defined in terms of other cards using a pattern similar to
# inheritance, except without the classes. There is no need for classes because
# there are no separate instances.
# Each Copper is a reference to the same single Copper object, for example.
#
# The `makeCard` function will define a new card and add it to the card list.
# `makeCard` works by copying an existing card object and applying a few new
# properties to it.
# 
# `name` is the name of the card, which will be the card's string
# representation and the key that you look it up in the card list `c` by.
# 
# To define a card independently of any existing card, let `origCard` be the
# abstract card called `basicCard`. To define a card in terms of another card,
# let `origCard` be that card object (probably a member of `c`, such as
# `c.Estate`).
# 
# `props` are the properties of the card that differ from its parent.
# 
# `fake` is true when this should be an abstract card, not a card in the
# supply. Fake cards are simply returned, not added to `c`.

#### The basicCard object
# `basicCard` contains all the things that are true by default
# about a card, plus many useful methods that will be available on all cards.

# object. Other cards give you such a benefit only under certain conditions,

# them happen. This takes in an object that describes the benefit, and
# applies it to the game state.
#
# The actions that can be performed through `applyBenefit` currently are:
#
# - `{cards: n}`: draw *n* cards
# - `{actions: n}`: get *+n* actions
# - `{buys: n}`: get *+n* buys
# - `{coins: n}`: get *+n* coins
# - `{trash: n}`: trash *n* cards
# - `{horseEffect: yes}`: gain 4 Silvers and discard your draw pile

# The AI has no rule in it that chooses `horseEffect`.
