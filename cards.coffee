# Dominion cards and their effects are defined in this file.  Each card is a
# singleton, immutable object.

# We begin by creating the `c` object, an exported object with which one can 
# look up any card by its name.

# Defining cards
# --------------
# Many cards are defined in terms of other cards using a pattern similar to
# inheritance, except without the classes. There is no need for classes because
# there are no separate instances.
# Each Copper is a reference to the same single Copper object, for example.
#
# The `makeCard` function will define a new card and add it to the card list.
# `makeCard` works by copying an existing card object and applying a few new
# properties to it.
# 
# `name` is the name of the card, which will be the card's string
# representation and the key that you look it up in the card list `c` by.
# 
# To define a card independently of any existing card, let `origCard` be the
# abstract card called `basicCard`. To define a card in terms of another card,
# let `origCard` be that card object (probably a member of `c`, such as
# `c.Estate`).
# 
# `props` are the properties of the card that differ from its parent.
# 
# `fake` is true when this should be an abstract card, not a card in the
# supply. Fake cards are simply returned, not added to `c`.

makeCard = (name, origCard, props, fake) ->
  newCard = {}
  for key, value of origCard
    newCard[key] = value
  newCard.name = name
  for key, value of props

  newCard.parent = origCard.name   # for debugging
  if not fake
    c[name] = newCard
    c.allCards.push(name)

#### The basicCard object
# `basicCard` contains all the things that are true by default
# about a card, plus many useful methods that will be available on all cards.
# All other cards should have `basicCard` as an ancestor. Many of the
# properties and methods of `basicCard` are meant to be overridden in
# real cards.

  # Card costs can change according to things external to the card, such as
  # bridges and quarries in play. Therefore, any code that wants to know the
  # actual cost of a card in a state should call `card.getCost(state)`.

  # bought whenever it is in the supply.

  # at the start of the game, to determine how many of them go into the supply.

  startingSupply: (state) -> 10

  #### Complex effects
  # More complex effects of a card can be defined using arbitrary functions
  # that modify the state. These functions are no-ops in `basicCard`, and
  # may be overridden by cards that need them:

  # - What happens when the card is bought?
  buyEffect: (state) ->
  # - What happens when the card is gained?
  gainEffect: (state) ->
  # - What happens (besides the simple effects defined above) when the card is
  #   played?

  # - What happens when this card is in play and another card is gained?
  gainInPlayEffect: (state, card) ->
  # - What happens when this card is in play and another card is specifically
  #   bought?
  buyInPlayEffect: (state, card) ->
  # - What happens when this card is cleaned up from play?
  cleanupEffect: (state) ->
  # - What happens when the card is in play as a Duration at the start of
  #   the turn?
  durationEffect: (state) ->
  # - What happens when the card is shuffled into the draw deck?
  shuffleEffect: (state) ->
  # - What happens when this card is in hand and an opponent plays an attack?
  reactToAttack: (state, player) ->
  # - What happens when this card is in hand and its owner gains a card?
  reactToGain: (state, player, card) ->
  # - What happens when this card is in hand and someone else gains a card?

# them happen. This takes in an object that describes the benefit, and
# applies it to the game state.
#
# The actions that can be performed through `applyBenefit` currently are:
#
# - `{cards: n}`: draw *n* cards
# - `{actions: n}`: get *+n* actions
# - `{buys: n}`: get *+n* buys
# - `{coins: n}`: get *+n* coins
# - `{trash: n}`: trash *n* cards
# - `{horseEffect: yes}`: gain 4 Silvers and discard your draw pile
